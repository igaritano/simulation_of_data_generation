# Description:
#
# This file contains the code to read a given input file line by line
# and to write it into an output file. Each line is read in a given
# time (seconds) interval. For debugging purposes each line is
# printed to the standard output.
# The program firsts evaluates the number of lines the given input
# file has. Then, within a loop, it reads the corresponding line
# number and it appends into a given output file. Moreover, it
# prints the line into the standard output. Finally, it waits
# (sleep) for a given amount of time (in seconds).
#
# Arguments:
#  1.- input file
#  2.- output file
#  3.- time interval in seconds
#
# ./datasources.sh input_file output_file time_interval
